# Slash-Command-Remover

Appears some people were having issues with removing Guild and Global commands from their application, which is why I decided to release this.


__Installation__
1. Create an empty folder named `commands` (cAsE sEnSiTivE)
2. Run `npm i`
3. Configure the file `config.json` (guildId is optional)
4. Run `node deploy-commands.js`

Enjoy :)

If you come across an issue feel free to send me a message on discord.
